;; Deals with the Jenkins console


;;; Code:

(provide 'butler-console)

(defun get-console-data (buffer server job offset)
  (let* ((url-request-method "GET")
         (base-url (gethash 'url server))
         (auth (gethash 'auth server))
         (url-request-extra-headers
          `(("Authorization" . ,auth)
            ("Content-Type" . "application/json")))
         (url (concat
               (if (string= "/" (substring base-url (- (length base-url) 1)))
                   (substring base-url 0 (- (length base-url) 1))
                 base-url)
               "/job/"
               (gethash 'name job)
               "/lastBuild/logText/progressiveText?start="
               (int-to-string offset))))
    (print url)
